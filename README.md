# Hexo Filter: Custom Permalinks

## What is it?

A filter for [Hexo](https://hexo.io) static site generator to allow custom permalinks to be defined on a post or page.

## Why does it exist?

I had the need to override the permalinks on some posts and pages.  This plugins enables me to define a
`custompermalink` in the frontmatter.

## Installation

1. Run `npm i @nibynool\hexo-filter-post-permalink` in your Hexo directory

## Usage

1. Add a `custompermalink:` line to your post or page frontmatter (eg `custompermalink: custom-permalink/`)
